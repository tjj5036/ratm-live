      <p>
        This is the list of shows that I'm searching for. If you have any of these shows, or even the setlists, please reach out! I'd love to add these all to the archive. Of course, if you have a show that isn't on this list or has a recording associated with it please get in touch - this is the holy grail of recordings that I know exist.

      <p>
        <a href="/artists/rage/concerts/1993-05-25-manchester-ritz">1993-05-25 The Ritz</a> - I have a MP3 of this show only and would love to get an upgrade.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/artists/rage/concerts/1996-05-03-madrid-festimad-fesival">1996-05-03 Festimad Festival</a> - Either audio or video would be awesome. Some of the Festimad videos have trickled out to Youtube, but I do not have a loseless copy of any.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/artists/rage/concerts/1997-04-19-pomona-the-glass-house">1997-04-19 The Glass House</a> - I learned recently that there is a recording of this show. Would love to learn what songs they played!
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/artists/rage/concerts/1997-07-24-osaka-imp-hall">1997-07-24 Osaka</a> - The 1997 Japan shows have remained pretty elusive!
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/artists/rage/concerts/1997-08-28-indianapolis-deer-creek-music-center">1997-08-28 Indianapolis</a> - I really like the Wu-Tang tour shows, and the setlist is not even known for this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/artists/rage/concerts/1997-09-05-dallas-starplex-amphitheatre">1997-09-05 Dallas</a> - given the rare songs they performed on this tour this show could potentially be a banger.
